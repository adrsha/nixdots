#!/usr/bin/env fish
# _gtk.fish — apply dark/light preference to GTK 3/4, Qt6, and the XDG portal.
#
# Firefox dark-mode: Firefox reads org.freedesktop.portal.Settings, which
# xdg-desktop-portal-gtk populates from gsettings and signals live via
# org.freedesktop.portal.Settings.SettingChanged.
#
# On Hyprland you need xdg-desktop-portal-gtk running alongside
# xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland so that the Settings interface is handled.
# Add to your hyprland.conf:
#   exec-once = /usr/lib/xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
#
# The old dbus-send call in this script used --type=method_call on
# Settings.Read — that just queries a value and does nothing useful.
# Removed. gsettings alone is the correct lever.
